# Password Generator
---
This generator will provide a password that is 16 characters in length and ensures that the password is generated with a mix of numbers, special characters and lower and upper case letters.

## Motivation behind this project
Prior to building this project I was asking myself how could I utilize Python at my current job.
As a Service Desk Technician I often have to provide users with new passwords when doing resets and our team was advised to not give out generic passwords.
Thinking of a new password everytime can get annoying, so I figured why not do it in Python as I'm currently learning it.
